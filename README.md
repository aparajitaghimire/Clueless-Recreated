# Clueless-Recreated
A project powered by the Raspberry Pi and inspired by the movie “Clueless,” in which the main character uses a computer program to select her outfit. Our project allows the user to take a photo of a shirt/pant they want to wear, uses machine learning to recognise the article of clothing, then parses through the user’s closet database and outputs the top ten matching shirts/pants.
